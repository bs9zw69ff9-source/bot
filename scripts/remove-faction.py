"""Remove factions from the bot's factions file, in place, by name.

    python3 scripts/remove-faction.py Kings Followers          # finds the file from .env
    python3 scripts/remove-faction.py --file f.json Kings      # or name it outright
    python3 scripts/remove-faction.py --dry-run Kings          # say what would change

IT FINDS THE FILE ITSELF, because the alternative was a shell one-liner to dig
FACTIONS_PATH out of .env, and that one-liner got the path wrong - which is the
exact failure this whole tool exists to stop. FACTIONS_PATH is resolved the way
the BOT resolves it, using dotenv 16's grammar as ported in
DotEnvConfiguration.cs: `export` prefixes ignored, `KEY=value` and `KEY: value`
both bind, quotes stripped, an unquoted value ending at the first `#`, and the
last assignment of a key winning. A real environment variable beats the file,
as it does for the bot. A relative path resolves against the directory holding
.env, which is the bot's working directory.

WHY NOT jq. The file is hand-edited config: FactionsFile.Load allows // comments
and trailing commas, and no JSON writer round-trips either. Parsing and
re-emitting would silently strip every comment in the file. So the faction
objects are cut out by brace matching and every other byte - comments,
alignment, blank lines - is left exactly as it was.

THE OBJECTS ARE FOUND STRUCTURALLY, not by searching for the name. A rank or a
sub-class may share a faction's name ("Elder" is both a Brotherhood rank and a
plausible faction), and a search that took the first match would cut the
enclosing object out of the middle of a different faction. Only the top-level
elements of the "factions" array are considered.

The previous file is kept alongside as <name>.bak.
